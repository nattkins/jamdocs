## Working in Government

We have worked across multiple offices of the state within the UK government

* Delivering a document management solution to maintain clear lines of communication between departments and with the wider electorate.
* Migrating 10s of TBs of documentation, and with it the supporting taxonomy and information site architecture 
* Creating an easy to use and up to date whole government department Org Chart - this was NOT just about the tech, this was mostly about getting stakeholders, ie everyone to play their part.
* Building apps for expenses, tracking constituency engagement 
* Making multiple departments find their own way in the transition to new, and evolving ways of working.
